# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis is to see how data differs by city type. Taking the rural, suburban and urban areas and analyze them to see where the total rides, total dirvers, average fares per ride and driver and total fare in the particular city. We need to summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data to the best of our ability using matplotlib to show a good visual.

## Results:

See the dataset below:

As you can see in the picture of the dataset above most of the rides and drivers are located in the urban areas. This would probably be because the amount of people on an urban area. The larger fares are in the rural areas. That would most likely be that way most likely because the distance to other things in a rural area are prbably farther apart making the trip longer therefore the trips would be more expensive.

The belwo graph shows the weekly fares by city. As you can see just like the above data set the urban area shows that is mostly likely where you're going to make all the revenue.

## Summary:

**My recommendations to the CEO would be:

- Keep a good amount of drivers in the urban area because that is wher we are seeing the most need for drivers based on the data and amount of people.
- I would also suggest to make an even amount of earnigs for your drivers to switch up where they are driving. Have your dirvers go to Urban areas some days and the others send them out to the Rural areas.
- Since you have less revenue in the rural and surburban areas consider raising your prices a little higher to compete with your amount of urban trips.
